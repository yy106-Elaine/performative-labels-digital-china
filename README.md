# Performative Labels Under Censorship  
### T/P/H Labeling Culture and Lesbian Identity in Digital China

This project investigates how lesbian identity labeling practices (T/P/H culture) are performed, transformed, and negotiated on Chinese short-video platforms, particularly Douyin.

This project develops an AI-assisted, multimodal research pipeline to study digital identity formation under platform governance in China. It combines computational social media analysis with cultural studies approaches to examine how identity is signaled through captions, visual presentation, and platform interaction patterns.

---

## Overview

This project builds a multi-stage research pipeline to:

- collect Douyin video URLs using identity-related keywords  
- extract video metadata and captions  
- filter relevant lesbian content using rule-based and multimodal methods  
- code identity signals in both visual and textual dimensions  
- merge coding results with engagement metrics (likes and comments)  
- construct a final analytical dataset  
- evaluate coding reliability through human annotation and Cohen’s kappa  

The analysis focuses on how labeling practices shift from traditional T/P/H categories toward more flexible and performative identity expressions.

More broadly, this project demonstrates how AI-assisted multimodal pipelines can scale qualitative cultural analysis into structured, reproducible computational research.

## Data Flow

The pipeline follows a multi-stage workflow:

1. **Data Collection**  
   Scrape Douyin video URLs using identity-related keywords.

2. **Metadata Extraction**  
   Extract captions and hashtag information.

3. **Filtering**  
   - Rule-based keyword filtering  
   - Multimodal refinement using AI (Gemini)

4. **Coding**  
   - Visual identity coding using Vertex AI  
   - Caption-based identity classification

5. **Data Integration**  
   Merge coding outputs with engagement metrics (likes and comments).

6. **Dataset Construction**  
   Build the final analytical dataset.

7. **Validation**  
   Conduct human annotation and compute Cohen’s kappa for reliability evaluation.

## Key Findings

- Identity labeling appears in over 50% of videos, functioning as a routine communicative system.
- Labeling practices have diversified beyond traditional T/P/H categories.
- Videos with identity signals show higher engagement, suggesting that labeling can function as a form of algorithmic capital.

## Research Significance

This repository is intended not only to document the findings of the project, but also to make the research workflow legible and reproducible.
Substantively, the project contributes to the study of lesbians' digital identity formation, platform governance, and queer cultural expression in contemporary China. Methodologically, it shows how AI-assisted multimodal coding can support computational social science research grounded in humanities interpretation.
